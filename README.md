# Promise Challenge

![Promise=>declare](./Pictures/Promise-declare.jpeg)

## Story
- The client comes from a religious background and isn't comfortable with the word "promise" being part of their software
- The client wants a new class to replace the Promise, called... Declare
- you can clone [this boilerplate Repo](https://github.com/suvelocity/PromiseBoilerplate) or create a new one. 
- Edit or add index.js to implement the Declare class. 

## requirements from the Declare class
1. is not implemented using the built-in Promise Class.
1. can create an instance with an **executor** function using the **new** keyword
1. has a **then** method, which returns a **Declare** instance
1. can use the return value of the **executor** with __then__ method
1. can use multiple **then**s chained one after the other
1. can use an asynchronous **executor**

* **NOTE** - there's no need to handle errors in this implementation.

#### **HOT TIP** - add `.skip` to the end of a test to skip it in a run, and only test what you want to.
```javascript
test.skip("Is not an instance of Promise", () => {
    const declare = new Declare(()=>{});
    return expect(declare instanceof Promise).toBe(false);
  });
```

- JS, how does it reads your code?
[Asynchrony: Under the Hood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrNQS8J67zc&feature=youtu.be)

- bind is a method in js, which pssing a 'this' value, to another function.
it is necessary to use this method in the implementation.
