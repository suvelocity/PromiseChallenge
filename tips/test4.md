## Can use the result of the declare using the "then" method
* every class has default values created by the constructor
* try and understand what type of input the constructor and the **then** method take and why.
* it is recommended for you to use 'bind' here. but were? well, that's a little bit tricky: you can call the function you pass to the constructor, and you should pass to her one of your Declare's methods, binded to 'this'.
